This awesome project represented a good way to improve my overall **JavaScript** knowledge, by implementing the _Search Tags_ feature.   
It has also helped me have my first contact with **GraphQL**, by migrating the existing services to a GraphQL implementation.

One of the achievements from this project is sustaining the additional features with **tests**.
