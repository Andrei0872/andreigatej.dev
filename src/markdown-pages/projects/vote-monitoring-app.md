Monitorizare Vot(Vote Monitoring) is a mobile app for monitoring elections by authorized observers. They can use the app in order to offer a real-time snapshot on what is going on at polling stations and they can report on any noticeable irregularities.

</p>

My contributions include: developing significant parts of the application(e.g the *Observers* view, the *Answers* view), implementing complex data-flows, fixing bugs. 

One of the most interesting challenges I've faced was to design a [reusable table component](https://github.com/code4romania/monitorizare-vot-ong/tree/develop/src/app/table). You can see how it looked like in [this file](https://www.figma.com/file/61NHR7fwmV1Dsv4Pb6F8T7/code4ro_mv_user-management_2018.04.21-(Copy))(*All responses* and *Observer management* is where I've used the table component).
