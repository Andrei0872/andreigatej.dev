Monitorizare Vot is a mobile app for monitoring elections by authorized observers. They can use the app in order to offer a real-time snapshot on what is going on at polling stations and they can report on any noticeable irregularities.

<br>

My contributions include: developing significant parts of the application(e.g the *Observers* view, the *Answers* view), implementing complex data-flows, fixing bugs.
