*An application meant to facilitate the process of writing up a traditional invoice. Keeping track of goods sent and services provided should be a computer's job.*

<br>

Apart from the many things I've learned from building this application, it also has a symbolic meaning to me. With this project I took part in an **national competition** and it eventually helped me win the **second place**.

<br>

One of my favorite discoveries was the use of **Stored Procedures** and **Triggers** in MySQL.
